Recipe Manager Roadmap

The Recipe Manager is a tool for people who not only wants to store and organize recipes but also discover new recipes. The development roadmap outlines the planned features and functionality for the project, with a focus on creating a user-friendly interface and providing valuable insights into recipe preferences and trends.

Milestone 1: Planning 

This is the phase to determine the requirements of the project and plan its development. This will involve:

	Define the scope of the project.

	Identify user requirements and use cases.

	Determining the technologies and tools to be used

	Create a project plan and timeline.

Milestone 2: Basic Functionality

Task 1 - Recipe Storage and Organization

This part will focus on allowing users to input and store recipes with details such as ingredients, instructions, cooking time, and serving size. Recipes will be organized into categories like cuisine type, meal type, or dietary preferences. This will involve:

Step 1: Create Recipe Class

Create a Recipe class with attributes such as name, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, serving size, cuisine type, meal type, and dietary preferences.

Step 2: Allow Users to Input and Store Recipes

Create a function that allows users to input and store their recipes with details such as ingredients, instructions, cooking time, and serving size. Save the recipes to a data file using a suitable data format.

Step 3: Organize Recipes by Categories

Create a function that allows users to organize their recipes into categories like cuisine type, meal type, or dietary preferences. This function should allow users to add or remove categories and assign recipes to them.

Step 4: Implement CRUD functionality

Create a function that allows users to create, read, update, delete  their recipes.

Task 2 - Recipe Search and Retrieval

This part will enable users to search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or categories. Relevant recipes will be retrieved and displayed with their details. This will involve:

Step 1: Implement Search by Keyword Functionality

Create a function that allows users to search for recipes based on keywords.

Step 2: Implement Search by Ingredient Functionality

Create a function that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients.

Step 3: Implement Search by Category Functionality

Create a function that allows users to search for recipes based on categories like cuisine type, meal type, or dietary preferences.

Step 4: Implement List All Recipes Function

Create a function that allows users to view a list of all the recipes they have saved.

Milestone 3: Advanced Functionality

Task 3 - Data Visualization and Analysis

Users will be provided with visualizations of their recipe collection, such as a breakdown of recipes by cuisine type or meal type in this part. Users will also be allowed to analyze trends in their recipe preferences, like the most common ingredients or preparation methods used. This will involve:

Step 1: Create Data Visualization Function

Create a function that provides users with visualizations of their recipe collection, such as a breakdown of recipes by cuisine type or meal type.

Step 2: Analyze Recipe Trends

Implement a function that allows users to analyze trends in their recipe preferences, such as the most common ingredients or preparation methods used.

Milestone 4: Additional Features

Task 4 - Sharing and importing

	Implement a sharing feature to allow users to share their recipes with others

	Implement a feature to allow users to import recipes from external sources

Task 5 - User Interface Improvement

	Refine the user interface to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.

Task 6 - Error Handling and Data Validation

	Implement error handling and data validation to prevent incorrect data entry and ensure data integrity.

Task 7 - Code Optimization and Documentation

	Optimize the code for efficiency and maintainability.

	Document the code to facilitate future maintenance and development.

Conclusion

The Recipe Manager is an ongoing project that will continue to evolve and improve over time. The above roadmap outlines the current tasks and features that are being worked on along with some additional features to work on in the future. Those updates will add new features and enhance existing ones, making the Recipe Manager an even more powerful tool for recipe management.
