# Recipe_Manager

Do you forget recipes very easily but like to cook different items? 
Are you tired of taking screenshots of recipes or writing them down? 
Have you misplaced your written recipes countless time?

If you are facing these problems then you can take a break here!!! We have developed a recipe management tool to solve your problems.


Recipe Manager is a Python-based application designed to help users store, organize, and discover new recipes. It is designed to simplify the process of keeping track of recipes and make it easy to find the perfect recipe for any occasion or any mood.

It is built to provide an efficient and easy-to-use platform allowing users to input and store recipes with details such as ingredients, instructions, cooking time, and serving size. The application also organizes recipes in categories like cuisine type, meal type, or dietary preferences, making it easier for users to manage their recipe collection.

The project has three main features:
1.	Recipe Storage and Organization
2.	Recipe Search and Retrieval
3.	Data Visualization and Analysis


Features

Recipe Storage and Organization

This feature allows users to input and store recipes with details such as ingredients, instructions, cooking time, and serving size. Users can input all the details of a recipe, and the application stores it in a database. The application also allows users to organize their recipes based on cuisine type, meal type, or dietary preferences. Users can easily add, read, edit or delete recipes as required.

Recipe Search and Retrieval

This second feature enables users to search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or categories. The application retrieves relevant recipes with their details, making it easier for users to find the recipes they are looking for. Users can use the search function to find recipes quickly and easily.

Data Visualization and Analysis

This feature provides users with visualizations of their recipe collection. The application provides a breakdown of recipes by cuisine type or meal type, allowing users to analyze trends in their recipe preferences, like the most common ingredients or preparation methods used. Users can also filter their recipe collection based on different parameters like cuisine type, meal type, or dietary preferences.
